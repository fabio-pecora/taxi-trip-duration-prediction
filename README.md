# taxi-trip-duration-prediction
This is a prediction of the duration of taxi trips in new york. I worked on the provided dataset using a Python library named Pandas which allowed me to improve the dataset by adding a lot of features such as weather, rush hours, weekend days, speed, and more. Talking about the creation of the Machine Learning model, we used Random Forest Regressor. Our final result of 0.37919 would have placed our team 193rd in a leaderboard of 1254 predictions.
